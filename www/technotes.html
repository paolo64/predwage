<h1>Technical Notes</h1>
The data are loaded from ISLR package.

A data frame with 3000 observations on the 12 variables.
Two of them, sex and region have been removed because they have always the same value.

<h2>Data used for train the model</h2>
<ul>
<li>year: Year that wage information was recorded</li>
<li>age: Age of worker</li>
<li>maritl: A factor with levels 1. Never Married 2. Married 3. Widowed 4. Divorced and 5. Separated indicating marital status</li>
<li>race: A factor with levels 1. White 2. Black 3. Asian and 4. Other indicating race</li>
<li>education: A factor with levels 1. < HS Grad 2. HS Grad 3. Some College 4. College Grad and 5. Advanced Degree indicating education level</li>


<li>jobclass: A factor with levels 1. Industrial and 2. Information indicating type of job</li>
<li>health: A factor with levels 1. <=Good and 2. >=Very Good indicating health level of worker</li>
<li>health_ins: A factor with levels 1. Yes and 2. No indicating whether worker has health insurance</li>
<li>wage: Workers raw wage [annual salary in USD]</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prediction Model</h2>
The algorithm used to predict wage from this data set is <strong>Linear Regression</strong>.
Ideally, we should predict wage in a way that accounts for the non-linear relationship between wage and age, 
using polynomial regression.
